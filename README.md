# üé¨ Movielingo App

**Movielingo** is an innovative language learning application powered by Flutter. It leverages the power of movies to offer an immersive and interactive language learning experience.

## üîë Key Features

- **Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up using Firebase and [Google Sign-In](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in)
- **Movie Listing**: Comprehensive display of movies, dynamically fetched from Firebase. The movie images are clickable, leading to the movie details page.
- **Movie Details**: Detailed information about the movie, including the title, release year, genre, and a brief synopsis. Using Firebase storage to store image files, the app also displays the movie poster.
- **User Profile Management**: Easy retrieval and editing of user details like name, email, first language, and target language.
- **Vocabulary Box**: A dedicated space to store the user's movies and series vocabulary.
- **Vocabulary Trainer**: The user can see the words, their meanings, and the context in which they were used in the movie. The user can also test their knowledge and track their progress.
- **Security**: See 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter, a versatile UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
- **Backend**: Firestore - a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database from Google Firebase, known for real-time data synchronization and robust offline capabilities.

## üèõ Software Architecture

Movielingo uses a Firebase Firestore database to store user data, movie details, vocabulary, the user's movies, the user's vocabulary and the user's progress. For more information on the database, please refer to [Movielingo Database](https://github.com/Movielingo/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md#-database).

For all possible CRUD operations, please refer to [Movielingo CRUD Operations](https://github.com/Movielingo/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md#-contribution-list).

### üïπÔ∏è Models

Movielingo uses various models to represent the data stored in the Firestore database. Some of the models include:

- **User**: Represents a user in the database with attributes like name, email, first language, target language, and the CSRFLevel of the user.

- **Movie**: Represents a movie in the database with attributes like title, genre, release year, and the vocabulary words connected to this movie.

- **UserMovie**: Represents a user's movie in the database with attributes like the movie ID, the user ID, and the progress of the user in this movie.

- **UserVocabulary**: Represents a user's vocabulary in the database with attributes like the word lemma, the word type, the word level, the user ID, the userMediaId, sentences containing the word, and the translation of the word.

### ü§ù Services

Movielingo uses various services to interact with the Firestore database. Some of the services include:

- **AuthService**: Provides methods to interact with the Authentication collection in the Firestore database, e.g., signing in, signing out, and registering a user.

- **UserService**: Provides methods to interact with the User collection in the Firestore database.

- **MediaService**: Provides methods to interact with the Movie collection in the Firestore database, e.g., fetching all movies, fetching a specific movie, and fetching the vocabulary of a specific movie.

- **UserMediaService**: Provides methods to interact with the UserMovie collection in the Firestore database, e.g., fetching all user movies, fetching a specific user movie, and updating the progress of a user movie.

- **VocabularyService**: Provides methods to interact with the UserVocabulary collection in the Firestore database, e.g., fetching all user vocabulary of a specific movie/series or adding new vocabulary to the user's vocabulary.

- **FirebaseStorageService**: Provides methods to interact with the Firebase Storage, e.g., uploading or fetching an image to/from the Firebase Storage.

### üé® Screens

- **AuthenticationScreen**: Displays the sign-in and sign-up forms. The user can sign in using their email and password or using Google Sign-In.

- **HomeScreen**: Displays the list of movies available in the database. The user can click on a movie to view its details.

- **MovieDetailsScreen**: Displays the details of a specific movie, including the title, genre, release year, and a brief description. The user can also add the movie to their list of movies (the so called "Vocabulary Box").

- **ProfileScreen**: Displays the user's profile information, including their name, email, first language, and target language. The user can also edit their profile information.

- **VocabularyBoxScreen**: Displays the user's list of movies. The user can click on a movie to view its vocabulary and progress. The user can also delete a movie from their list of movies. The user can also start the vocabulary trainer for a specific movie.

- **VocabularyTrainerScreen (WIP)**: Displays the user's vocabulary for a specific movie. The user can see the words, their meanings, and the context in which they were used in the movie. The user can also test their knowledge and track their progress.

## üîí Security

### Implement Security Measures
1. Firebase Security Rules with field-level security and input validation rules
2. Set up Authentication and Authorization with Firebase Auth
3. Implemented stronger password practices
4. Additional Authentication option with Google Sign-In
5. Input Validation for SignUp and SignIn forms (with password validation, validation if the email already exists, etc.)
6. Firebase App Check for attestation to protect my API resources from abuse by preventing unauthorized clients from accessing my backend resources
